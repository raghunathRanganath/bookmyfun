            <h3>Please find below the brief summary of this event</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We start from Bangalore on Friday night and reach Coorg between 5 and 6 AM on Saturday morning.</li>
                <li>At about 8 AM after freshening up, and a quick breakfast, we will proceed to the trail head, a short drive away.</li>
                <li>A quick introduction and briefing and we begin our trek to Tadiandamol from where the vehicle trail ends.</li>
                <li>The trail is quite well defined and is more or less level for the first four odd kilometers until we reach the big boulder for a brief rest.</li>
                <li>The incline of the trail from here on gradually increases.</li>
                <li>Next we enter into the Shola jungle. The trail from here on becomes very steep.</li>
                <li>Twenty odd minutes later, we leave the jungle to hit the last and final stretch that leads to the peak. This stretch is approximately 300 meters long but will seem much more longer (just like any other final ascent.) </li>
                <li>We will spend some time at the peak to rest, have our packed lunch and enjoy the panoramic views, after which we will descend at a slow comfortable pace back to the base.</li>
                <li>A short drive later and we are back at our home-stay, followed by dinner and a blissful night's rest.</li>
                <li>Next morning we wake up by 7 AM to freshen up and have breakfast, following which we will continue to the Chalwara/Chelavara falls for a refreshing dip.</li>
                <li>We begin for Bangalore a little before noon and are likely to reach here by about 9 PM in the evening.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>NOTE:</h3>
